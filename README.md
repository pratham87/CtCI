# Questions:

## Ch 1. Arrays and Strings

1. [Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you can not use additional data structures?](https://github.com/pratham87/CtCI/tree/master/src/main/java/arraysAndStrings/Q1) 

2. Write code to reverse a C-Style String. (C-String means that “abcd” is represented as  ve characters, including the null character.)

3. Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string without using any additional bu er. NOTE: One or two additional variables are  ne. An extra copy of the array is not. FOLLOW UP: Write the test cases for this method.

4. [Write a method to decide if two strings are anagrams or not](https://github.com/pratham87/CtCI/tree/master/src/main/java/arraysAndStrings/Q2)    

5. Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with ‘%20’.

## Ch 2. Linked Lists

1. Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list. FOLLOW UP: How would you solve this problem if a temporary bu er is not allowed? 

2. Implement an algorithm to  nd the nth to last element of a singly linked list.

3. Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a single linked list, given only access to that node. EXAMPLE Input: the node ‘c’ from the linked list a->b->c->d->e Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a->b->d->e

4. You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a sin- gle digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1’s digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list. EXAMPLE Input: (3 -> 1 -> 5) + (5 -> 9 -> 2), Output: 8 -> 0 -> 8

5. Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns node at the begin- ning of the loop. DEFINITION: Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node’s next pointer points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list. EXAMPLE input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier], output: C

## Ch 3. Stacks and Queues

1. Describe how you could use a single array to implement three stacks.

2. How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, also has a function min which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should all operate in O(1) time.

3. Implement a MyQueue class which implements a queue using two stacks.

4. Write a program to sort a stack in ascending order. You should not make any assump- tions about how the stack is implemented. The following are the only functions that should be used to write this program: push | pop | peek | isEmpty.

## Ch 4. Trees and Graphs

1. Implement a function to check if a tree is balanced. For the purposes of this question, a balanced tree is de ned to be a tree such that no two leaf nodes di er in distance from the root by more than one.

2. Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to  nd out whether there is a route be- tween two nodes.

3. Given a sorted (increasing order) array, write an algorithm to create a binary tree with minimal height.

4. Given a binary search tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth (i.e., if you have a tree with depth D, you’ll have D linked lists).

5. Write an algorithm to  nd the ‘next’ node (i.e., in-order successor) of a given node in a binary search tree where each node has a link to its parent.
