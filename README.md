# Questions:

## Ch 1. Arrays and Strings

* ###### [Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you can not use additional data structures?](https://github.com/pratham87/CtCI/tree/master/src/main/java/arraysAndStrings/Q1) 

* ###### Write code to reverse a C-Style String. (C-String means that “abcd” is represented as  ve characters, including the null character.)

* ###### Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string without using any additional bu er. NOTE: One or two additional variables are  ne. An extra copy of the array is not. FOLLOW UP: Write the test cases for this method.

* ###### [Write a method to decide if two strings are anagrams or not](https://github.com/pratham87/CtCI/tree/master/src/main/java/arraysAndStrings/Q2)    

* ###### Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with ‘%20’.

## Ch 2. Linked Lists

* ###### Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list. FOLLOW UP: How would you solve this problem if a temporary bu er is not allowed? 

* ###### Implement an algorithm to  nd the nth to last element of a singly linked list.

* ###### Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a single linked list, given only access to that node. EXAMPLE Input: the node ‘c’ from the linked list a->b->c->d->e Result: nothing is returned, but the new linked list looks like a->b->d->e
